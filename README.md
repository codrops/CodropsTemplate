## How to use this template:

- Change the HTML as you wish, the only thing needed is the "codrops-top" division
- The general styles for the demo page are in demo.css
- The styles for the component go into component.css
- If there are more demos, call the files index.html, index2.html, index3.html etc. and link to them from the "codrops-demos" nav
- Modernizr is used for HTML5Shiv. If you need anything else just replace it with your custom build: http://modernizr.com/download/
- Add JS files to the js folder
- The README.md can be used to add licensing information of resources used
- For writing the tutorial, take a look at some guidelines in article.html
